Made Quiet a lot of changes to PeteTimesSix's Research Reinvented: Stepping Stones Mod by merging the entire Thinking Spot 
Mod by PartyCowboy into it. Also added a lot of personal flavor over time. A few examples:

- I was not satisfied that the primary source of food in neolithic times is pemmican, so I added roasted meat and veggie mush that can be made over a campfire.
- The thinking spot can only research **neolithic** tech researches (The idea of researching electricity while sitting somewhere on the ground is a little silly to me)
- Added starting faction that starts with nothing and two scenarios, naked brutality extreme and lost tribe(no research)
- A lot more I don't remember

Original Discription:
*A companion mod for Research Reinvented that modifies the vanilla research tree to one with a more discreet, logical progression.*
